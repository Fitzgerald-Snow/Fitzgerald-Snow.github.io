                Hi, I'm interested in maths, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. I'm specifically interested in <mark class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-1">decision making, emotion, and intelligence</mark>. I also have a peripheral interest in complexity science. The approaches I currently take are reinforcement learning and neural (network) modelling. Beyond healthy neuroscience, I'm also interested in computational psychiatry, especially the mechanisms of anxiety, fear and depression.

                        I'm actively building a unified computational framework for <span class="font-semibold text-sky-700">decision making, emotion, and adaptive intelligence</span>. 
                        The core of my current work blends biologically grounded reinforcement learning, cortico-limbic circuit modelling, and representational geometries for affective state encoding. 
                        I'm particularly interested in how uncertainty, valuation, and internal state dynamics interact to produce flexible behavior.

                    <p>
                        Methodologically I oscillate between: (1) mechanistic neural models (spiking + rate abstractions), (2) differentiable RL architectures with neuromodulatory channels, and (3) mathematical formalization (information theory & dynamical systems) of cognitive-emotional integration.

                            <li><span class="font-bold">Arbitration between Model Free and Model Based control:</span> In Lee et al, 2014, they proposed a reliability based arbitration model of model free and model based control. Their model is very complicated, and I try to test whether a simpler and equally intuitive arbitration model can explain the behavior well. The code for the work: <a href="https://github.com/PrinceAesthetic/Loss4Arbitration-MB-MF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-sky-500 hover:underline">https://github.com/PrinceAesthetic/Loss4Arbitration-MB-MF</a> This work is advised by <a href="https://ruyuanzhang.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-sky-500 hover:underline">Dr. Ruyuan Zhang</a> at Shanghai JiaoTong University.</li>
                            <li><span class="font-bold">CSP with Graphical Models:</span> Real world problems are high-dimensional. To solve them we have to find efficient representation of the problem at hand, and I believe representation learning is the bridge from simple decision making to problem solving. Here I try to study how human solve constraint satisfying problems with graphical models, for example, does the brain implement belief propagation algorithms to solve a map coloring problem or a sudoku. This work is still in its infancy and is advised by <a href="https://qyanglab.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-sky-500 hover:underline">Dr. Qianli Yang</a> at East China Normal University.</li>

                        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-slate-700">
                            <li><span class="font-bold">Competition and Cooperation between Habitual and Goal-directed systems:</span> As I was working on the arbitration model(as mentioned in active threads), I searched for the literature related to the arbitration of the two systems. Starting from Daw's research paper in 2005, which proposed that control is allocated to the system that has a lower uncertainty over the outcome, to Kool, Cushman and Gershman's papers in the late 2010s where they propose that cost-benefit trade off lies at the heart of the arbitration process, many models and hypothesis have been proposed to unravel the two systems problem. I wonder if there is some unifying principle behind it. Also, as previous research are all primarily Daw's 2011 two-stage-task or with simple alterations, I wonder whether there is a better task to study this process.</li>
                            <li> <span class="font-bold">Neuronal memory/classification capacity, and Linear FI:</span> In SueYeon Chung's 2018 paper, they proposed from the perspective of statistical mechanics measures of the representation manifold that explain neuronal classification capacity. In Yu-Ang Cheng's 2025 paper(advised by Dr. Ruyuan Zhang), they proposed that linear fisher information predicts the visual systems' classification ability. I have been trying to reproduce all the mathematical formula in Chung's paper and in Gardner's classic papers on statistical mechanics. I wonder what is the relation between the two studies, i.e. does the two measures share mathematical homologies. </li>
                            <li> <span class="font-bold">Meta-RL in the brain:</span> I'm interested in meta-learning (learning to learn) and meta-reinforcement-learning. Human experience thousands of decisions to make everyday, with many unseen before, and they can leverage past experience to rapidly adapt to new situations. Like in the game of go, it's impossible to experience every arrangement of board, but with some kind of generalization you can spot some similar structures as you've encountered before, and decide which might be the best move in a new situation. Botvinick proposed in a 2019 paper that the PFC implement meta-RL. Also, I'm curious how the brain decides in such a large goal space which goal to achieve today, for example to do an experiment or to have a good meal.</li>
                            <li> <span class="font-bold">Metacognition of decision making(?):</span> I'm interested in meta-cognition. Sometimes I wonder what's the relation between the too-often mentioned model free and model based systems apropos of the two-stage-task, and the more realistic situations where human consciously calculate the outcomes of actions and make plans. Also I believe it has something to do with certain psychiatric disorders.</li>
                            <li> <span class="font-bold">RL algorithms in the brain:</span> I'm curious whether many of the classic but more complicated reinforcement learning algorithms have their counterpart in the brain. For example in a 2014 paper by Gershman, Markman and Otto, they devised a task to test whether the brain is implementing Dyna-Q, which is an RL algorithm that proposed model based agent's model can be used to train the model free system. There are also other classic algorithms in RL but which have not been studied in human before, for example value function approximation algorithms, Deep Q-Networks etc.</li>
                            <li> <span class="font-bold">How does working memory affect model based control:</span> I'm curious how to computationally model working memory's affect on model based control. Model based control relies on actively remember the world model, including the transition probabilities and the rewards associated with each states. When you're tired or if the bandwidth of your working memory is small, your model based control's function might be impaired. So far the only notable propositions are from Anne Collins and Otto and their collaborators.</li>
